# FrequencyPowerAbstraction_for_KarmaLego
This code for abstraction of data was used in my reasearch predicting deep TMS treatment responce for 
Major Depression Disorder (MDD) using EEG data. In my research I achieved ~85% accuarcy and F1 scores for 82 patients.

The code purpose is to create an ordinal categorical levels abstraction for each 
electrode (channel) from the eeg, frequency band, time interval combination based on frequency power. 

look inside the resp there are 2 extended manuals in pdf
